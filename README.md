# Project Documentation

## Project Overview
Module 6 hackaton - We decided to create a theme switcher that has 3 default choice. Light, Dark and Pastel.
After selecting theme, .js will capture and save the theme. After the page is reloaded, the saved theme will be the default. 

## Team Members:

-   Matthew T

## Collaborative Work

Module 6 hackaton is designed and scripted collaborative with each members presenting their own idea.
Color was chosen by each member.
